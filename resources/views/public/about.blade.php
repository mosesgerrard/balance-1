       		      		<h2>The Balance Concept Note</h2>
       			        <p> The rate at which young people are braving the merciless ocean in the hopes of gaining a
       			            better life abroad is disheartening. Our brothers are daily perishing on the seas and this
       			            is because they lose all hope of being able to make something of themselves in their own
       			            country. These are the young people who are supposed to be the future of our country. What
       			            sort of future is our country going to have if we lose them all to the seas?
       			        </p>
       			        <p> The Balance Crew is an organization with a deeply profound concern for the future of the
       			            country and the well being of the youths. We want to transform into an NGO that will basically
       			            be a platform for the development of young people. Our young people are talented. Some of them
       			            would like to put their talents into good use but lack the capital to do so. To say that this
       			            is frustrating for them will be an understatement.
       			        </p>
       			        <p> The mean reason why we want to form this NGO is to reduce the rate of unemployment and to
       			            support the youths who are working in this country as laborers. We want to make sure that
       			            their rights are not infringed upon, that they are not sacked unjustly, that their salaries
       			            are paid in time; in short, we want the youths to feel safe in their working environments.
       			        </p>
                    <hr role="separator" class="divider">

                        <h2>Our Goals</h2>
                        <p> We would like to have a memorandum of understanding with labour union, ministry of youths
                            and sports, central government and office of the ombudsman. The only way that our plans can
                            be a success is if we have the support of these entities.
                        </p>
                        <p> We want an Act to be written that is going to be nationalized. What this Act will contain
                            is that the all the business enterprises in this country will have to respond whenever the
                            Balance summons them and all their employers can register as members of the Balance if they
                            want to. If they register the balance will look after their interests in their work place
                            with the backing of the labour union.
                        </p>
                        <p> When the youths who are unemployed join our organization, we would train them in their area
                            of interest for example carpentry and we would also provide them with capital to start
                            their own business with the help of our stakeholders. But that is not all. We would also
                            help them market their products through the partnership we would have with GRTS. Companies
                            and individuals alike will be called upon to buy their products and advertise for their
                            businesses at the same time. This will be done in the form of a trade fair on a day we are
                            going to call the MARKET DAY.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Our Action Plan</h2>
                        <p> Our organization will be divided into sectors such as innovation team which will comprise
                            of a group of gifted young people in various areas. They may or may not be educated but
                            they will be people with brilliant ideas that will be tapped and nurtured for the
                            socio-economic development of the nation. Experts would be brought in to guide these young
                            people in order for them to be able to harness their capabilities and put them into good use.
                        </p>
                        <p> There would also be a monitoring team. This team will be responsible for taking care of the
                            welfare of our members. They would be monitoring their work places to make sure that they
                            are treated fairly. They would seek out finance for them to stand on their own feet.
                            In general, they would serve as the body that would take care of the member’s well
                            being and interests.
                        </p>
                        <p> The administration team will of course be responsible for running the affairs of the
                            organization. The CEO and his executives will make sure that the organization runs
                            smoothly and that all money transactions are transparent and that the members will never
                            be kept in the dark about the financial status of the organization.
                        </p>
                        <p> Although profit will be derived from what we are proposing, it is in no way what is
                            motivating us. We want to give the young people a safe haven and a means of livelihood.
                            We want to give them hope that they can succeed in their own country. We want to reduce
                            the rate of massive unemployment that is present in the country. Most importantly,
                            we want to discourage illegal migration. The only way illegal migration can be successfully
                            wiped out is if the youths are given something else to engage themselves in. otherwise,
                            all the talking would fall on deaf ears.
                        </p>
                        <p> We have our good intentions and our determination to do this but we need support for it
                            to be implemented. Finance is needed as well. It is not in our possession.
                            It is our belief that the central government whose main concern is development
                            will support us whole-heartedly in this cause.
                        </p>
